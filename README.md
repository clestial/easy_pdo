PDO MySQL Library

## Original author
EasyPDO was coded by [Rob Poyntz](mailto:rob@digitalfinery.com.au) and the original can be found[here](http://easypdo.robpoyntz.com/)

## What's different with this repo then?
I first wanted support for named statements, also didn't like the singleton stuff, and then i kept adding stuff.
Robs hasn't update the package for a couple of years, so... here we are.
(I only use, and work with, the mysql part. So the rest is there just for completeness)

Changelog is in the files.

## Original authors description
EasyPDO is small PHP library that provides an easy and secure way to interact with a database. EasyPDO makes writing parameterised queries a breeze, and can dramatically reduce the amount of code you need to write.

Originally coded as a private project using PHP's MySQLi drivers, EasyPDO evolved into something which could potentially:

- Save developers time
- Make web applications more secure
- Simplify your codebase
- Help reduce programming errors
- EasyPDO has been tested on MySQL v5.0, SQLite3 and Postgres v8.4. There is a good chance it will work with any of the other databases supported by PDO.

Support for MySQLi has now been dropped.
